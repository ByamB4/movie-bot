1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
The movie is set in a dystopian 
future where technology has  

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,380
become indispensable in performing 
just about any task. At the start,  

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:12,180
a man named Stripe dreams about a beautiful 
woman. Soon, he wakes up and it is revealed  

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:16,260
that Stripe is a new military recruit. He 
is set to go on a mission with his squad,  

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,940
which includes a female soldier named Hunter 
Raiman and an arrogant soldier; Leonard.

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,660
Stripe’s team has been tasked with checking out 
an infestation of “roaches” in a nearby village.  

7
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,580
Roaches are pale, snarling, humanoid 
monsters with sharp teeth. Apparently,  

8
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:36,720
these creatures are vicious and they prey on 
innocent people. It is Stripe's first field day  

9
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,760
after his training so he is nervous and scared. 
But when Raiman encourages him, he gets riled up.

10
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,600
Shortly after, the squad arrives at a 
village, which has just been looted by a  

11
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,100
bunch of roaches. The terrified villagers try 
to explain the situation, but they speak in a  

12
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,480
different language, which the soldiers can’t 
comprehend. So, the group’s commander; Medina,  

13
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,860
takes out a translator and starts interrogating 
the villagers. She eventually learns that the  

14
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:04,319
roaches escaped in the direction of someone named 
Parn Heidekker. Parn is a solitary religious freak  

15
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,400
who is apparently suffering from mental health 
issues. The locals claim that he let roaches  

16
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,200
cross his land and even left out food for them. 
In the meantime, Stripe individually speaks  

17
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,700
to the villagers and promises to one of them 
that he will try his best to keep them safe.

18
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,920
Suspecting that Parn is helping the roaches,  

19
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,520
the soldiers head out for his compound. 
It is then revealed that each soldier  

20
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,500
in the military has a neural implant called 
MASS embedded in their brain which provides  

21
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,840
data via AR or “Augmented Reality”. MASS also 
helps the military in strategic operations.

22
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,360
Soon, the squad reaches Parn’s large compound 
and plans their raid using holographic maps and  

23
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,160
data displays, which each soldier has access to 
thanks to the implants in their brains. Medina,  

24
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,840
Stripe, Raiman and Leonard are in charge of 
talking to Parn and searching the main house  

25
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,020
while the others are assigned with 
raiding the nearby outer buildings.

26
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,760
Executing their mission, Medina knocks on the 
door and demands to inspect his home. A few  

27
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,960
seconds later, a scared Parn answers and 
it appears as if he is the only one home.  

28
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,940
Although reluctant at first, he lets the soldiers 
inside his house. Raiman and Stripe quickly go  

29
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:11,039
about searching upstairs while Medina and Leonard 
interrogate Parn. After talking to him for a bit,  

30
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:16,140
Medina notices some religious symbols decorating 
the walls. This makes her realize that Parn is  

31
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:20,280
simply looking out for the roaches because 
of some religious beliefs that all living  

32
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,840
species must be protected. She attempts to 
disabuse him of this notion by discussing the  

33
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,460
supposed sickness in the roaches’ blood, which 
doesn’t care about ideals of common humanity.  

34
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:34,260
She also tells him that the roaches need to be 
exterminated if humanity is going to survive.

35
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,820
Meanwhile, Stripe and Raiman search the room 
upstairs to check for any roaches. They come  

36
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:46,260
across a hidden room and decide to split up. In 
one room, Stripe sees a blanket with multiple  

37
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:51,060
shadows behind it. When he lifts the blanket, 
he finds three terrifying roaches there. The  

38
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:57,480
roaches appear to be pale humanoids with sharp 
teeth, flattened noses and discolored eyes. One  

39
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,860
of them holds up a mysterious device with a green 
light. Stripe immediately shoots one in the head  

40
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:06,240
and starts tussling with another. As the creature 
attempts to bite him, he draws out his knife and  

41
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:11,700
stabs the roach in the chest. Even after it is 
dead, a disturbed Stripe continues stabbing it.

42
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:16,080
After the encounter, he examines the mysterious 
green light device and experiences a flash  

43
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,060
which causes a slight strain in his eyes. As 
Raiman rushes to help him, she is knocked down  

44
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,380
the stairs by an escaping roach. At the 
same time, Parn attempts to stab Medina,  

45
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,340
but he is easily subdued and taken into 
custody. Before heading back to their base,  

46
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:34,320
Medina decides to set the compound on fire, which 
also destroys the mysterious green light device.

47
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:39,120
The next day, Raiman is seen practicing her 
sharpshooting against roach targets, so that  

48
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,920
none get away the next time. It is evident that 
she is envious of a newbie like Stripe killing two  

49
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,080
roaches on his first day. Soon, Stripe arrives 
and joins in on the exercise. He aims at his  

50
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:55,140
target but suddenly, his neural implant glitches 
and he ends up missing. This worries Raiman but  

51
00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:00,360
Stripe insists that he is fine. However, during 
push up exercises, his neural implant continues  

52
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,560
to glitch which affects his performance. Medina 
notices this and orders him to see a doctor.

53
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,060
Resolving to get to the bottom of the issue, 
Stripe follows his commander's orders and goes  

54
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:13,200
to the military hospital. The doctor runs 
a diagnostic test on Stripe’s implant but  

55
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,579
fails to find anything wrong. After a while, 
Stripe tries to open up about the green device  

56
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:21,239
which he found at Parn’s compound, but 
the doctor doesn’t understand anything,  

57
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:25,440
and simply refers him to a person called 
Arquette. It turns out Arquette is a  

58
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,520
resident military psychologist. He suspects 
that Stripe's problem may have something to  

59
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,600
do with the fact that he killed two roaches 
brutally. He also claims that a few days of  

60
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,100
proper rest should resolve everything. Before 
parting ways, Arquette promises to get Stripe  

61
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,240
an extremely good sleep by programming 
something special for his dreams that night.

62
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,740
This dream involves the return of Stripe’s 
recurring fantasy of the beautiful woman  

63
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:51,180
surrounded by flowing drapes. This time, 
though, it’s more intense. The lights are  

64
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,960
red and she asks him to have coetus with 
her. Stripe gives in and the two have a  

65
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,220
wonderful time but just then, the glitch 
turns up again, forcing him to wake up.  

66
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,780
He sits up in his bunk and looks over his 
comrades, who are all peacefully sleeping.

67
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,800
The next day, Stripe, Raiman and Medina are 
back in the village helping out with food  

68
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,880
and supplies. There, Medina informs the group 
that a piece of information was extracted on  

69
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,440
the roaches’ whereabouts from Parn. Hence, the 
squad heads out to the said location to perform  

70
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:21,420
a recon. After a while, the trio arrives at 
an abandoned area and plans their recon with  

71
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:26,220
the help of a drone and their MASS implants. As 
the group continues discussing, Stripe's implant  

72
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:31,980
glitches out again and malfunctions. Suddenly, 
he realizes that he can smell the grass which he  

73
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:36,420
could not before when the implant was working. 
He tries to explain it to Raiman but she simply  

74
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:41,400
ignores him. All of a sudden, shots are fired and 
Medina is struck in the head, instantly killing  

75
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,260
her. Despite the setback, Raiman somehow retrieves 
the drone from the crossfire and uses it to locate  

76
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:50,640
the shooter. It turns out that the roaches 
are holed up in a room with a stolen rifle.

77
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:55,380
Stripe seems distraught but Raiman decides to make 
their way into the compound providing cover fire  

78
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:59,880
for each other. Stripe, who is still confused 
and dizzy after the implant stopped working,  

79
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,520
reluctantly agrees and follows his comrade.

80
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,680
There, the two find a kind of makeshift electronic 
workshop, probably the source of that green-light  

81
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,240
device from earlier. Shortly after, Stripe 
finds something even more surprising. He  

82
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,920
sees a normal-looking woman hiding out in one 
of the rooms, begging for her life. She doesn’t  

83
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:21,360
look like a roach, so Stripe tells her to get 
out of there, promising not to hurt her. She  

84
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,340
slowly backs into the hallway, attempting to 
flee, but shockingly, Raiman shoots her dead.

85
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,840
This stuns Stripe and he questions why she killed 
a civilian. But she simply brushes him aside and  

86
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,700
moves forward, going on a killing spree, mowing 
down all the roaches in the building. Strangely,  

87
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,540
from Stripe's perspective, all the 
roaches she kills look like normal humans,  

88
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:44,040
which shocks him even more. Raiman then 
proceeds to kill a frightened mother-son duo,  

89
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:48,420
but before she can do so, Stripe intervenes 
and knocks her unconscious. Sadly,  

90
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:53,100
he also gets shot in the process. After a 
while, he staggers to his feet and escapes  

91
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,880
with the mother and son while profusely 
bleeding. As Stripe leads them to safety,  

92
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,020
Raiman wakes up and witnesses them getting 
in the military vehicle and fleeing.

93
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,820
After having been shot in the belly and losing a 
lot of blood, Stripe passes out behind the wheel,  

94
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:09,600
making the car come to a complete stop in 
the middle of the woods. Then, the woman  

95
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:15,360
drags Stripe into her small hidden cave made up of 
twigs and dirt and begins to treat his wound. He  

96
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,080
soon regains consciousness and gets startled 
by the woman applying bandages on his wound.  

97
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:24,660
The woman introduces herself as Katarina and her 
son as Alec. She then makes a major revelation.  

98
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:29,400
It turns out that the Roaches the military has 
been hunting are just normal beings. It is the  

99
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,020
MASS implant that alters the soldiers’ senses, 
and makes them look like inhumane monsters.  

100
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:38,580
This is because the higher-class people look 
upon the ‘roaches’ as some disease-ridden,  

101
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:43,380
poor, and unintelligent beings. Katarina also 
reveals that the green-light device used on  

102
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:47,580
Stripe was built by her friend to mess with 
the implants and make the soldiers see the  

103
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:53,340
roaches as their real selves i.e., humans. The 
roaches are victims of a genocide justified by  

104
00:07:53,340 --> 00:08:01,020
the military as genetic cleansing. A stunned 
Stripe asks why the villagers hate the roaches,  

105
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,800
despite them having no such implants. 
Katarina responds that while the locals  

106
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,520
see the roaches as humans, they still 
treat them as inferior due to propaganda.

107
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:13,260
It turns out 10 years ago, the governments 
ran DNA checks all around the world which  

108
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:17,160
changed everything. People with genetic 
predispositions to illnesses were categorized  

109
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,300
as roaches which was a campaign set in 
motion by television and internet media.

110
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,740
Unfortunately, as the two continue talking, 
Raiman tracks them down. The two ‘roaches’  

111
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,880
try running away, but they are immediately 
shot and killed. This traumatizes Stripe and  

112
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,120
he breathes heavily as Raiman walks 
up to him while pointing her gun at  

113
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,900
him. She then demands an explanation 
for his earlier betrayal but Stripe,  

114
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:41,159
who is still in a state of shock and 
remorse, keeps murmuring to himself “None  

115
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:45,480
of this is true ''. Sadly, this only puzzles 
Raiman, and she knocks him out with her gun.

116
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,680
In the next scene, Stripe wakes up in a 
white-walled cell crouching in the corner. Soon,  

117
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,760
Arquette pays him a visit and offers him 
coffee. He also apologizes to Stripe for  

118
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,080
failing to catch the glitch in his neural implant 
sooner. The psychologist then explains that the  

119
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,100
green device he found in the farmhouse was 
reverse engineered by the roaches from some  

120
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:06,000
of the military’s drone parts. The light in 
the device transmits a code which is like a  

121
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,640
virus. It burrows into one’s MASS and tries to 
shut it down from within. However, Stripes calls  

122
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,960
everything a lie and insists that the roaches 
look just like them. Arquette acknowledges it,  

123
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:20,760
but also claims that the roaches are dangerous. He 
then adds that humans are genuinely empathetic as  

124
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,840
a species. And this is why creatures like 
the roaches are taking advantage of them.

125
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:29,460
Following this, Arquette gives the example 
of World War II during which most soldiers  

126
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:33,720
didn’t fire their weapons or if they did, they 
would just aim over the heads of their enemies  

127
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,880
on purpose. In numbers, only 15 to 20% of the 
soldiers would pull the trigger. The fate of the  

128
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,440
world was at stake but only a small fraction of 
them fired. Arquette comments that the war would  

129
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,880
have gotten over a whole lot quicker had the 
military grown some cojones and did their job.

130
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,080
Because of this, the officials had to figure 
out a way to work around humans’ natural empathy  

131
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,240
as many soldiers were afraid to kill. Arquette 
reveals that MASS alters soldiers' senses such  

132
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,740
as smell and sound so that they can kill without 
hesitation or remorse. He then shows a video  

133
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:06,600
evidence where Stripe consented to the memory and 
sense altering effects of the Mass procedure. It  

134
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,520
turns out that after Stripe was implanted with 
the MASS, all his previous memories were erased.

135
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:16,200
Furious, Stripe attempts to attack Arquette, 
but the latter uses the implant to blind him.  

136
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,400
The cunning psychologist then offers him two 
choices. Stripe can either allow the military  

137
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:25,680
to reset his implant, wiping out his memory of 
the past few days and this very conservation,  

138
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,360
or to be incarcerated forever. Initially, 
Stripe chooses to be incarcerated.

139
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,680
To help him reconsider, Arquette plays the 
footage of the first mission in his mind. However,  

140
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:39,120
in this footage, Stripe sees the real events 
that unfolded without the alteration of the  

141

MASS system. He witnesses himself brutally 
murdering and stabbing normal people which  

142
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,360
he then saw as roaches. He also learns that 
the roach that had escaped from Stripe's first  

143
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:53,160
mission was actually Katarina. As expected, 
the footage breaks Stripe from the inside,  

144
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,520
and he eventually decides to wipe 
out his memory of the past few days.

145
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:01,380
In the final scene, Stripe, now a decorated 
officer, leaves his base and approaches  

146
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:05,400
a house. He has tears streaming down 
his face as he smiles and watches the  

147
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,660
girl from his dreams walk towards him 
from the empty and dilapidated house.
